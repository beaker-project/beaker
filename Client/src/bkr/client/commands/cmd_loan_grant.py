bkr loan-grant: Grant a loan for a Beaker system
================================================

.. program:: bkr loan-grant

Synopsis
--------

:program:`bkr loan-grant` [*options*] <fqdn>

Description
-----------

Grant a loan for a Beaker system.

The designated user will have full permissions to reserve, provision and
schedule jobs on that system, even if they would not normally have such
access.

While a system is on loan, only the loan recipient and the system owner
will have permission to reserve or otherwise use the system.

.. versionadded:: 0.15.2

Options
-------

.. option:: --recipient

   Username of the loan recipient (defaults to the user issuing the command)

.. option:: --comment

   Comment regarding the loan (for example, the reason for it)


Common :program:`bkr` options are described in the :ref:`Options 
<common-options>` section of :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Exit status
-----------

Non-zero on error, otherwise zero.

Examples
--------

Temporarily grant a user exclusive access to a particular system::

    bkr loan-grant --recipient jdoe system1.example.invalid
    # jdoe now has almost exclusive access to use the system
    bkr loan-return system1.example.invalid
    # Either jdoe or a user with permission to loan the system to other users
    # can return the granted loan
