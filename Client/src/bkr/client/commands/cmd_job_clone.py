bkr job-clone: Clone existing Beaker jobs
=========================================

.. program:: bkr job-clone

Synopsis
--------

| :program:`bkr job-clone` [*options*]
|       [--wait] [--dry-run] [--xml] [--pretty-xml] <taskspec>...

Description
-----------

Specify one or more <taskspec> arguments to be cloned. A new job will be 
created for each argument. The cloned job ids will be printed to stdout.

The <taskspec> arguments follow the same format as in other :program:`bkr` 
subcommands (for example, ``J:1234``). See :ref:`Specifying tasks <taskspec>` 
in :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Only jobs and recipe sets may be cloned.

Options
-------

.. option:: --wait

   When this option is given, the command will not terminate until the clone
   job has finished running.

.. option:: --xml

   Print the job XML before submitting it.

.. option:: --pretty-xml

   Print the job XML in a easily readable format before submitting it.

.. option:: --dry-run

   Run through the job-clone process without actually submitting the cloned job

.. option:: --job-owner <username>

   Clone the job on behalf of <username>. The cloned job will be owned by
   <username> rather than the cloning user.

   The cloning user must be a submission delegate of <username>. Users can
   add other users as submission delegates on their :guilabel:`Preferences`
   page in Beaker's web UI.



Common :program:`bkr` options are described in the :ref:`Options 
<common-options>` section of :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Exit status
-----------

Non-zero on error, otherwise zero.
A failure in cloning *any* of the arguments is considered to be an error, and 
the exit status will be 1.

Examples
--------

Clone job 1234 and wait for it to finish::

    bkr job-clone --wait J:1234
