bkr job-watch: Watch the progress of a Beaker job
=================================================

.. program:: bkr job-watch

Synopsis
--------

:program:`bkr job-watch` [*options*] <taskspec>...

Description
-----------

Specify one or more <taskspec> arguments to be watched. Each state change will 
be reported to stdout. The command will exit only when everything is finished.

The <taskspec> arguments follow the same format as in other :program:`bkr` 
subcommands (for example, ``J:1234``). See :ref:`Specifying tasks <taskspec>` 
in :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Options
-------

Common :program:`bkr` options are described in the :ref:`Options 
<common-options>` section of :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Exit status
-----------

Non-zero on error, otherwise zero.

Bugs
----

In its current implementation this command polls the Beaker server periodically 
for state changes. To avoid overloading the server, only the given <taskspec> 
arguments and none of their subcomponents are watched. This limitation will 
be addressed in an upcoming release (most likely by switching to a message 
bus).

Examples
--------

Watch the progress of job 12345 and all recipes within it::

    bkr job-watch J:12345

Due to the limitation noted above, this won't actually watch any recipes within 
the job, although it should.
