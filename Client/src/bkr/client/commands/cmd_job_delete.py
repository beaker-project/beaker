bkr job-delete: Delete Beaker jobs
==================================

.. program:: bkr job-delete

Synopsis
--------

Delete specific jobs:

| :program:`bkr job-delete` [*options*] [--dryrun] <taskspec>...

Delete by criteria:

| :program:`bkr job-delete` [*options*] [--dryrun]
|       [:option:`--family` <family>] [:option:`--tag` <tag>] [:option:`--product` <cpeid>] [:option:`--completeDays` <days>]

Description
-----------

Specify one or more <taskspec> arguments to be deleted.

The <taskspec> arguments follow the same format as in other :program:`bkr` 
subcommands (for example, ``J:1234``). See :ref:`Specifying tasks <taskspec>` 
in :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Only jobs may be deleted.

Options
-------

This command accepts the same options for selecting jobs as :program:`bkr 
job-list` does. See the :ref:`Options <job-list-options>` section of 
:manpage:`bkr-job-list(1)`.

.. option:: --dryrun

   Do not perform any deletions.

.. option:: --family <family>

   Delete jobs which ran with distro belonging to <family>, for example
   ``RedHatEnterpriseLinuxServer5``.

.. option:: --completeDays <days>

   Delete jobs which finished at least <days> ago.

.. option:: --tag <tag>

   Delete jobs which have retention tag <tag>, for example ``scratch``.

.. option:: --product <cpeid>

   Delete jobs which were testing the product identified by <cpeid>.

Common :program:`bkr` options are described in the :ref:`Options 
<common-options>` section of :manpage:`bkr(1)`.

Exit status
-----------

Non-zero on error, otherwise zero.

Examples
--------

Delete all scratch jobs which finished 30 or more days ago:

    bkr job-delete --tag scratch --completeDays 30
