== How to run tests ==

Just execute `runtests.sh` if you want all the tests to run
   OR
Execute this script with a list of files you want execute tests from

E.g.:   $ ./runtests.sh beakerlibTest.sh   # run only tests from "beakerlibTest.sh"

== How to add a test ==

Just create "*Test.sh" file here, which contains functions named
"test*" which uses ShUnit2 asserts. See ShUnit2 documentation:

 * https://fedorahosted.org/beaker/wiki/BeakerLib/CodingStyle#Unittests
 * http://www.forestent.com/wiki/ShUnit2:Main_Page
 * http://shunit2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/shunit2/trunk/source/2.0/doc/shunit2.html

== How runtests.sh works? ==

It just generates `runtests-worker.sh` script and then it executes it.

Why are we calling tests like this? I mean why are we creating new
script in this funny way, then executing it and parsing its output
for result?

Well, because I do not know how to do that better. I'm open to
improvements :-)
