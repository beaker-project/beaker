Bug 835367: running createrepo all the time is inefficient
----------------------------------------------------------

There was a change in how we generate repodata so the existing repodata
directory must be deleted.

    rm -rf /var/www/beaker/rpms/repodata

We also need to drop the task.oldrpm column, but first get a list of old RPMs
to be deleted:

    mysql $CREDENTIALS beaker -B -N \
        -e 'SELECT oldrpm FROM task WHERE oldrpm IS NOT NULL;' \
        >oldrpms.txt

The RPMs in this list should not be deleted immediately since some existing
recipes may refer to them and will try to install them. Delete them a few days
after upgrading.

Now you can run the following SQL to drop the column:

    ALTER TABLE task DROP oldrpm;

To roll back, delete the repodata directory again:

    rm -rf /var/www/beaker/rpms/repodata

and restore the dropped column (but we won't have the old data to restore):

    ALTER TABLE task
        ADD COLUMN oldrpm VARCHAR(2048) DEFAULT NULL;


Remove system_id from watchdog table
------------------------------------

Run the following SQL:

    ALTER TABLE watchdog
        DROP FOREIGN KEY watchdog_ibfk_4, -- system_id FK
        DROP COLUMN system_id;

To roll back, run the following SQL:

    ALTER TABLE watchdog
        ADD COLUMN system_id INT AFTER id;
    UPDATE watchdog
        INNER JOIN recipe ON watchdog.recipe_id = recipe.id
        SET watchdog.system_id = recipe.system_id;
    ALTER TABLE watchdog
        MODIFY system_id INT NOT NULL,
        ADD CONSTRAINT watchdog_system_id_fk
            FOREIGN KEY (system_id) REFERENCES system (id);


Remove recipe_role and recipe_task_role tables
----------------------------------------------

Run the following SQL:

    DROP TABLE recipe_role;
    DROP TABLE recipe_task_role;

To roll back, run beaker-init to recreate the recipe_role and recipe_task_role
tables, then run the following SQL to populate them:

    INSERT INTO recipe_role (id, recipe_id, role, system_id)
        SELECT NULL, id, role, system_id
        FROM recipe;
    INSERT INTO recipe_task_role (id, recipe_task_id, role, system_id)
        SELECT NULL, recipe_task.id, recipe.role, recipe.system_id
        FROM recipe_task
        INNER JOIN recipe ON recipe_task.recipe_id = recipe.id;


New tables recipe_resource, system_resource, guest_resource (bug 655009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding with this step, ensure that you have a CSV file to re-create
your Virtual system records in case you need to roll back. If you don't already
have one, use Beaker’s CSV export feature. If you don't have any Virtual system
records, ignore this step.

First run beaker-init to create the new tables, and then run the following SQL
to populate them:

    INSERT INTO recipe_resource (id, recipe_id, type, fqdn)
        SELECT NULL, recipe.id, 'system', system.fqdn
        FROM recipe
        INNER JOIN system ON recipe.system_id = system.id
        WHERE system.type != 'Virtual';
    INSERT INTO system_resource (id, system_id, reservation_id)
        SELECT recipe_resource.id, recipe.system_id, recipe.reservation_id
        FROM recipe
        INNER JOIN recipe_resource ON recipe_resource.recipe_id = recipe.id
            AND recipe_resource.type = 'system';

    INSERT INTO recipe_resource (id, recipe_id, type, fqdn)
        SELECT NULL, recipe.id, 'guest', system.fqdn
        FROM recipe
        INNER JOIN system ON recipe.system_id = system.id
        WHERE system.type = 'Virtual';
    INSERT INTO guest_resource (id)
        SELECT recipe_resource.id
        FROM recipe
        INNER JOIN recipe_resource ON recipe_resource.recipe_id = recipe.id
            AND recipe_resource.type = 'guest';

    ALTER TABLE recipe
        DROP FOREIGN KEY recipe_ibfk_4, -- system_id FK
        DROP COLUMN system_id,
        DROP FOREIGN KEY recipe_reservation_id_fk,
        DROP COLUMN reservation_id;

    DELETE FROM reservation
        USING reservation
        INNER JOIN system ON reservation.system_id = system.id
        WHERE system.type = 'Virtual';
    DELETE FROM system_status_duration
        USING system_status_duration
        INNER JOIN system ON system_status_duration.system_id = system.id
        WHERE system.type = 'Virtual';
    DELETE FROM system_activity
        USING system_activity
        INNER JOIN system ON system_activity.system_id = system.id
        WHERE system.type = 'Virtual';
    DELETE FROM activity
        USING activity
        LEFT JOIN system_activity ON activity.id = system_activity.id
        WHERE type = 'system_activity' AND system_activity.id IS NULL;
    DELETE FROM system
        WHERE type = 'Virtual';
    ALTER TABLE system
        CHANGE type type ENUM('Machine', 'Resource', 'Laptop', 'Prototype') NOT NULL;

To roll back, first restore the dropped columns:

    ALTER TABLE recipe
        ADD COLUMN system_id INT DEFAULT NULL AFTER distro_tree_id,
        ADD CONSTRAINT recipe_system_id_fk
            FOREIGN KEY (system_id) REFERENCES system (id),
        ADD COLUMN reservation_id INT DEFAULT NULL AFTER autopick_random,
        ADD CONSTRAINT recipe_reservation_id_fk
            FOREIGN KEY (reservation_id) REFERENCES reservation (id);
    ALTER TABLE system
        CHANGE type type ENUM('Machine', 'Virtual', 'Resource', 'Laptop', 'Prototype') NOT NULL;

Then use the CSV file you saved to re-create your Virtual system records (if
you had any). Then run the following SQL to populate the restored columns:

    UPDATE recipe
        INNER JOIN recipe_resource ON recipe_resource.recipe_id = recipe.id
        INNER JOIN system_resource ON recipe_resource.id = system_resource.id
        SET recipe.system_id = system_resource.system_id,
            recipe.reservation_id = system_resource.reservation_id;
    UPDATE recipe
        INNER JOIN recipe_resource ON recipe_resource.recipe_id = recipe.id
        INNER JOIN guest_resource ON recipe_resource.id = guest_resource.id
        INNER JOIN system ON recipe_resource.fqdn = system.fqdn
        SET recipe.system_id = system.id;
