Older versions of beaker-log-delete did not always correctly delete all logs 
for a job before marking it as "deleted" (we now call this "purged").

If there is any job which has been purged, but still has associated log_* rows, 
we clear the purged timestamp so that beaker-log-delete will try purging again.
