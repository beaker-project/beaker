Data migration script related to Alembic revision 51637c12cbd9, which creates 
the installation table.

The Alembic migration back-populates the installation table based on existing 
recipe_resource rows, however for system_resource (recipes run on systems) the 
migration leaves kernel_options empty. This online migration is filling in the 
kernel options, which requires matching up command_queue rows to their 
corresponding recipes.

There is no direct record of the relationship between commands and the recipe 
that triggered them. So we have to guess, by finding commands enqueued between 
the start and finish times of the reservation corresponding to each recipe.

The 'auto_cmd_handler' callback string is the indicator that a command was 
enqueued by the scheduler as part of provisioning a recipe, rather than by 
a user manually or by release action ReProvision.
