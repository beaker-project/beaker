This is an additional online migration re Alembic revision 3ba776df4c76 and the
already existing insert-installation-row-for-scheduled-recipes-before-25.py
migration script. With the deployment of the online migration, we found
additional regressions in scheduled jobs before the Beaker 25 migration. These
cases have been documented on Bug 1568224 comments 12 and 13. The cases boil
down to two distinct situations:

    a) Two recipes in a recipeset where scheduled, one failed to
       provision due to a bug in the code, while the other provisioned fine.
       The status of the recipe is a transient state: 'Waiting'
    b) The recipes have either been cancelled or aborted due to not
       matching systems or by a cancelled request by the user.
