		<title>Install Beaker</title>
		 <para>
			To install Beaker packages (and dependencies) you'll need to get the repo file then copy it to your <emphasis>/etc/yum.repos.d/</emphasis> directory.
		</para>
		 <para>
			There are two main repos. One containing packages needed for installing the Beaker server and required components, another for packages needed to run the Beaker client. Basic tasks needed by Beaker can also be found <ulink url="http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/beaker/tasks">here</ulink>. You can find the repo directory <ulink url="http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/beaker/">here</ulink>. Please download the repo file that suits your requirements.
		</para>
		 <section id="Installation-Install_Beaker-Disabling_Repos">
			<title>Disabling Repos</title>
			 <para>
				Disable other repos to ensure that packages are installed from the beaker repo.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Install the dependencies 
<screen>$ yum -y install rpm-build python-devel TurboGears python-TurboMail
$ yum -y install mod_wsgi python-decorator python-tgexpandingformwidget python-xmltramp
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Install Beaker server. 
<screen>$ yum install beaker-server
</screen>

			</para>

		 <section id="Installation-Install_Beaker-Install_DB">
			<title>Install DB</title>
			 <para>
				Beaker supports MySQL,MSSQL,Oracle,MaxDB,PostgreSQL, and SQLite. For this tutorial,we will use MySQL. First, make sure MySQL server is installed, and configure the daemon to run at startup. 
<screen>$ yum install -y mysql-server MySQL-python
$ chkconfig mysqld on
$ service mysqld start
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Create a database, and grant access to beaker user. You can put the database on the local machine, or on a remote machine. In the example below, the database is hosted on the local machine. 
<screen>
    $ echo "create database beaker;" | mysql
    $ echo "grant all on beaker.* to 'beaker'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'beaker';"| mysql
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Now let's initialise our DB with tables. We'll also create an admin account called <emphasis>admin</emphasis> with password <emphasis>testing</emphasis>.
			</para>

		</section>
		
		 <section id="Installation-Install_Beaker-Start_Beaker">
			<title>Start Beaker</title>
			 <para>
				We are now ready to start the Beaker service. Make sure you have the following line in your /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf and that it is uncommented. 
<screen>
       LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				First make sure apache is on and configured to run on startup. 
<screen>
      $ sudo chkconfig httpd on
      $ sudo /sbin/service/httpd start
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				We need to switch SELinux off. 
<screen>
      $ setenforce 0
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Due to permission issues, we need to delete the log file before we start Beaker for the first time. Otherwise Beaker will not run properly. 
<screen>
       $ sudo rm /var/log/beaker/server*.log
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Start Beaker and configure it to run on startup. 
<screen>
       $ sudo chkconfig beakerd on
       $ sudo /sbin/service beakerd start
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				To make sure Beaker is running go to <ulink url="http://BeakerServer.example.com/bkr/ in your browser" />

				<title>Add Lab Controller details</title>
				 <para>
					One more step that we need to do is add the Lab Controller that we are yet to configure<xref linkend="Installation-Setup_Lab_Controller" />. Login in at<ulink url="http://BeakerServer.example.com/bkr/labcontrollers/new" /> . Use the username and password above from the beaker-init command. The new lab controller form requires 3 fields 
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								<application>FQDN</application>: This is the fully qualified domain name of the lab controller.
							</para>

						</listitem>
						 <listitem>
							<para>
								<application>Username</application>: This is the login name that the lab controller will use to login to beaker. Because this is a machine account we recommend prepending it with host/, so for example host/lab_controller.example.com
							</para>

						</listitem>
						 <listitem>
							<para>
								<application>Password</application>: This is the password that goes along with the username, again we will use : <emphasis>testing</emphasis>
							</para>

						</listitem>
						 <listitem>
							<para>
								<application>Lab Controller Email Address</application>: All user accounts require a unique email address, you can use root@FQDN of lab controller.
							</para>

						</listitem>
						 <listitem>
							<para>
								<application>Cobbler Username</application>:This is the login name we will use to communicate with the lab controller, for the purposes of this document will use the login name <literal>testing</literal>

			</formalpara>
			 <para>
				The new lab controller also needs a user account. Login at:

        http://BeakerServer.example.com/bkr/users/new
</screen>
				 <itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<application>Login</application>: Should be the host/FQDN (FQDN is the fully qualified domain of the lab controller).

					</listitem>

						<para>
							<application>Display Name</application>: Should be just FQDN.
						</para>

					</listitem>

			 <para>
				Beaker/Server needs a little more info than cobbler normally stores about a distro in order to use it. Thats why beaker-lab-controller provides a script in /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/sync/post/osversion.trigger which needs to be run after you import a new distro. It looks up the distros full family.update and looks for any yum repos that may be in the distro path. It also adds the cobbler distros into the Beaker server. 
<screen>
  $ /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/sync/post/osversion.trigger
</screen>

			</para>
			 <para>
				Check that the Disto was added succesfully by going to <ulink url="https://BeakerServer.example.com/bkr/distros" />.You'll need to configure the /etc/beaker/proxy.conf file with the following settings. 
<screen>
  # Hub xml-rpc address.
  HUB_URL = "https://BeakerServer.example.com/bkr"
  #HUB_URL = "http://localhost:8080"
  
  # Hub authentication method. Example: krbv, password, worker_key
  AUTH_METHOD = "password"
  #AUTH_METHOD = "krbv"
  
  # Username and password
  USERNAME = "host/lab.example.com"  # This needs to match the account your created on the Beaker Scheduler
  PASSWORD = "testing"  # Again, only if you are not using kerberos does this need to be set.
  
  # Kerberos service prefix. Example: host, HTTP
  KRB_SERVICE = "HTTP"
  
  # Kerberos realm. If commented, last two parts of domain name are used. Example: MYDOMAIN.COM.
  KRB_REALM = "EXAMPLE.COM"

			You'll then need to configure how your Beaker client authenticates with the Beaker server. You can use either password authentication, or kerberos authentication. For password add the following: 
<screen>
          AUTH_METHOD = "password"
          USERNAME = "username"
          PASSWORD = "password"
</screen>

		</para>
		 <para>
			If instead kerberos authentication is preferred: 
<screen>
          AUTH_METHOD = "krbv"
          KRB_REALM = "krb_realm"
</screen>

		</para>
		 <para>
			To verify it is working properly: 
<screen>
          $ bkr list-labcontrollers
</screen>

		</para>
		 <para>
			It should return a list of labcontrollers configured in Beaker.
		</para>

			To create a simple Job workflow, the beaker client comes with the command<command>bkr workflow-simple</command> . This simple Job workflow will create the XML for you from various options passed in a the shell prompt, and submit this to the Beaker server. To see all the options that can be passed to the <command> workflow-simple,</command> use the following command: 
<screen>
          $ bkr workflow-simple --help
</screen>

		</para>
		 <para>
			A common set of paramaters that may be passed to the workflow-simple options would be the following: 
<screen>
         $ bkr workflow-simple --username=&lt;user&gt; --password=&lt;passwd&gt; --dryrun
              --arch=&lt;arch&gt; --distro=&lt;distro_name&gt; --task=&lt;task_name&gt;
              --type=&lt;TYPE&gt; --whiteboard=&lt;whiteboard_name&gt; --debug &gt; my_job.xml

		 <para>
			To submit an existing Job workflow: 
<screen>
        bkr job-submit job_xml
</screen>

		</para>
		 <para>
			If succesful, you will be shown the Job ID and the progress of your Job.

		 <para>
			To watch a Job: 
<screen>
        $ bkr job-watch J:job_id
</screen>

			To cancel a Job you have created: 
<screen>
       $ bkr job-cancel J:job_id
</screen>
