% Cobbler migration

As of version 0.9, Beaker no longer relies on Cobbler for provisioning systems.
A new lab controller daemon, beaker-provision, executes power commands and
manages the TFTP root. Kickstarts are generated by and served from the Beaker
server.

Within Beaker itself, complete compatibility has been maintained and the change
should be largely invisible. In particular, kickstart metadata for systems and
recipes will behave the same as in previous releases.

However, if your site is using any Cobbler functionality directly you may need
to take steps to migrate the configuration to Beaker.


Install options for Cobbler distros
-----------------------------------

If you have set kickstart metadata, kernel options, or post-install kernel
options for any distros in Cobbler (for example using `cobbler distro edit`)
you will need to find the equivalent distro tree in Beaker's web UI and set the
options there. The format and meaning of the install options in Beaker are the
same as in Cobbler.


Power scripts
-------------

When executing power commands, Beaker uses shell scripts which are based on
Cobbler's power templates which are installed in `/etc/cobbler/power`. If you
have customised any of Cobbler's power templates you may need to add a custom
Beaker power script with the same modifications. Refer to [Customizing Power
Commands](http://www.beaker-project.org/guide/Administration.html#Administration-Customizing_Power_Commands)
in the Beaker Guide.

Note that Beaker uses shell scripts rather than Cheetah templates for power
commands, even though the shell scripts look very similar because the variable
names are the same. You can examine the default scripts in
`/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/bkr/labcontroller/power-scripts` for
inspiration.


Netboot config files
--------------------

Beaker does not use templates for generating bootloader configs when
provisioning a system (Cobbler's /etc/cobbler/pxe/pxesystem.template etc).
Customizing these configs is not supported.

Unlike Cobbler, Beaker does *not* manage the default bootloader config
($TFTP_ROOT/pxelinux.cfg/default, and equivalent files for other bootloaders).
You can continue to let Cobbler put its PXE menu here, or you can manage this
file by hand. Beaker's only requirement for automated provisioning is that the
it must default to local booting with a sensible timeout (the Cobbler PXE menu
does this).


Snippets
--------

Snippets are now located on the Beaker server (rather than the lab controller),
under `/etc/beaker/snippets`.

Beaker uses Jinja2 for templating, so templates will need to be rewritten.
Refer to the [Jinja2 documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) for details
of the template syntax, and to [Customizing
Kickstarts](http://www.beaker-project.org/guide/Administration.html#Administration-Customizing_Kickstarts)
in the Beaker Guide for details about the Beaker specifics.

For your convenience, some common Cobbler template constructs are shown below,
along with their equivalent in Beaker.

Accessing a variable:

    $getVar('ondisk', '')

    {{ ondisk }}

Looping:

    #set _devices = $getVar('scsidevices', '').split(',')
    #for $device in $_devices:
    device $device
    #end for

    {% for device in scsidevices|split(',') %}
    device {{ device }}
    {% endfor %}

Conditional on distro version:

    #if $os_version == "rhel3"
    #set $yum = "yum-2.2.2-1.rhts.EL3.noarch.rpm"
    #end if

    {% if distro is osmajor('RedHatEnterpriseLinux3') %}
    {% set yum = 'yum-2.2.2-1.rhts.EL3.noarch.rpm' %}
    {% endif %}


Other Cobbler system management features
----------------------------------------

Cobbler's func integration, managed config files, and RHN registration features
are incompatible with Beaker.

DHCP and DNS services are outside the scope of Beaker, so if you are using
Cobbler to manage these in the lab then you can continue to do so. However, if
you are relying on Cobbler's network config scripts when provisioning systems
(that is, the `pre_install_network_config`, `network_config`, and
`post_install_network_config` snippets) you must migrate this configuration to
DHCP instead.

If a system has particular network configuration needs not covered by DHCP, you
can add a per-system snippet for it as appropriate: `system_pre` for
pre-installation scripts, `network` for Anaconda network commands, or
`system_post` for post-installation scripts. Refer to [Customizing
Kickstarts](http://www.beaker-project.org/guide/Administration.html#Administration-Customizing_Kickstarts)
in the Beaker Guide for details.
