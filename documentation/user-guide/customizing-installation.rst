Customizing the installation
============================

Beaker provides a number of ways to customize the distro installation which 
happens at the start of each recipe.

.. _install-options:

Install options
---------------

In Beaker, install options are a set of three related argument strings in the 
form ``foo=barÂ baz=qux``. Kernel options are passed on the kernel command line 
when the installer is booted. Post-install kernel options (labelled 
:guilabel:`Kernel Options Post` in the web UI) are set in the boot loader 
configuration, to be passed on the kernel command line *after* installation. 
Kickstart metadata variables are passed to the kickstart template engine, and 
can be used to control the content of the kickstart in various ways.

All three options can be set:

* by administrators at the OS version and distro tree levels
  (see :ref:`admin-os-versions`)
* by system owners on a per-system basis (see :ref:`system-details-tabs`)
* by job submitters in each individual recipe (see :ref:`job-workflow-details`)

Beaker combines all the install options in the order listed above to determine 
the effective install options for each recipe.

.. todo::

   Describe syntax of the options, rules for parsing/unparsing, and how 
   combining/overriding works.

.. _kernel-options:

Kernel options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most kernel options are passed as-is on the kernel command line when the 
installer is booted.
Refer to the distro documentation for details about kernel options supported by 
the installer.

The following kernel options are treated specially by Beaker:

``ks=<url>``
    This option is passed as-is on the kernel command line. It specifies the 
    kickstart file for Anaconda.

    Beaker performs no extra processing on this kernel option, however if it is 
    present Beaker skips all of the normal mechanisms for kickstart generation 
    using templates and variables (described below). The kickstart used for 
    provisioning will be the one given in this option.

``initrd=<tftp path>``
    Extra initrd/initramfs image to load, in addition to the initrd image for 
    the distro installer. Use this to apply updates to the installer image, or 
    to supply additional drivers for installation.

    If the boot loader supports multiple initrd images, Beaker extracts the 
    ``initrd=`` option from the kernel command line and appends it to the boot 
    loader configuration.

``devicetree=<tftp path>``
    Alternate device tree binary to load. Use this to supply a different device 
    tree binary than the one built into the kernel.

    If the boot loader supports passing a device tree to the kernel (currently 
    only GRUB for AArch64), Beaker extracts the ``devicetree=`` option from the 
    kernel command line and appends it to the boot loader configuration.

``netbootloader=<tftp path to bootloader>``
    Netboot loader image to use. Beaker creates a symlink so the TFTP
    path :file:`bootloader/{fqdn}/image` serves the specified
    image.

    Set this option if you want to boot an alternative image. For example,
    if the administrator has made an older version of PXELINUX available in
    the TFTP root as :file:`pxelinux-311.0`, you can boot it using
    ``netbootloader=pxelinux-311.0``.

    By default Beaker uses the most suitable boot loader for the chosen
    distro and architecture:

    - i386/x86_64: :file:`pxelinux.0`
    - ia64: :file:`elilo-ia64.efi`
    - ppc: :file:`yaboot`
    - aarch64: :file:`aarch64/bootaa64.efi`

    For ppc64 and ppc64le, for Fedora, RHEL 7.1 and later:

    - :file:`boot/grub2/powerpc-ieee1275/core.elf`

    and for RHEL 7.0 and earlier:

    - :file:`yaboot`

    Note that this option will have no effect if the system has a
    hard-coded boot loader filename in the DHCP configuration. For configurable
    netboot loader support the DHCP configuration must specify the
    filename as :file:`bootloader/{fqdn}/image`. See :ref:`system-dhcp`.

.. _kickstart-metadata:

Kickstart metadata (ks_meta)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variables are supported and can be selected by placing them in
the ``ks_meta`` attribute in the ``recipe`` element. In many cases, these
variables correspond to the similarly-named kickstart option.

For example in the job XML::

    ...
    <recipe kernel_options="" kernel_options_post="" ks_meta="harness=restraint hwclock_is_utc" role="None" whiteboard="Lab Controller">
    ...

``auth=<authentication configuration options>``
    Authentication configuration to use. For example,
    ``auth='--enableshadow --enablemd5'``. See
    :manpage:`authconfig(8)` to learn more.

``autopart_type=<fstype>``
    Partioning scheme for automatic partitioning (must be one of ``lvm``,
    ``btrfs``, ``plain`` and ``thinp``). On supported distros, it is
    passed as ``--type <fstype>`` to the  ``autopart`` kickstart
    command. On distros where ``autopart`` does not support the
    ``--type`` option, this is ignored.

``beah_rpm=<pkgarg>``
    Name of the Beah RPM to be installed. The value can be any package 
    specification accepted by yum (for example it can include a version, such 
    as ``beah-0.6.48``). The default is ``beah`` which installs the latest 
    version from the harness repos. This variable has no effect when using 
    alternative harnesses.

``beah_no_console_output``
    If specified, Beah will not send any log messages to /dev/console. The log 
    messages will still be available in the systemd journal (on systemd-based 
    distros).

``beah_no_ipv6``
    If specified, Beah will function in IPv4 only mode even if IPv6
    connectivity is possible.

``bootloader_type``
    Specify an alternative bootloader. It is passed on to the ``bootloader``
    kickstart command.

``dhcp_networks=<device>[;<device>...]``
    Configure additional network devices to start on boot with DHCP activation. 
    The device should be given as a kernel device name (for example, ``em1``) 
    or MAC address.

    Note that the network device used for installation is always set to start 
    on boot with DHCP activation.

``conflicts_groups``
    This is a list of comps.xml group ids (without the @ symbol) which contain 
    packages conflicting with the rest of the package set, e.g. Samba 3 vs. 
    Samba 4. Empty list is a valid value as well so templates can iterate over 
    the list without testing if the variable has been defined. Usually 
    applicable for RHEL and CentOS.

``contained_harness``
    If specified, runs the test harness and hence the tasks in a Docker
    container. The test harness to be run defaults to "restraint". A
    different test harness can be specified using the ``harness``
    variable. Also see ``contained_harness_entrypoint`` below.

    The host distro and architecture must support Docker for this to
    be possible.

``contained_harness_entrypoint=<entrypoint>``
    Specify how the harness should be started. This defaults to
    "/usr/sbin/init" and expects "systemd" to be the process
    manager. Alternatively, another binary can be specified. The entry
    point must be in one of the forms understood by Docker's `CMD
    instruction <http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#cmd>`__.

    This is only required if the test harness is run in a Docker
    container. See ``contained_harness`` above.

``contained_harness_ro_host_volumes=</volume1>[,</volume2>..]``
   Specify the host volumes to be mounted as read-only inside the container. The
   default volumes mounted as read-only are
   ``/var/log/messages``, ``/etc/localtime`` and
   ``/etc/timezone``.

   For example, ``contained_harness_ro_host_volumes='/var/run,/etc'`` will
   then mount ``/var/run`` and ``/etc`` as read-only volumes.

``contained_harness_rw_host_volumes=</volume1>[,</volume2>..]``
   Specify the host volumes to be mounted with write permissions inside the container. The
   default volumes with write permissions are ``/mnt`` and
   ``/root``.

   For example, ``harness_rw_host_volumes='/myvolume'`` will then only
   mount the ``/myvolume`` with write permissions.

``disable_repo_<id>``
    Disable repo of the given id. By default, the kickstart will include repo.
    Repo is also created in yum.repos.d/ and enabled. Set this variable if you
    want to omit ``repo`` command in kickstart and disable it in yum.repos.d/.
    You can find repo id for a particular distro tree under the
    :guilabel:`Repos` tab on the distro tree page.
    For example disable_repo_CRB.

``disable_<type>_repos``
    Disable repos of the given types. Valid types include ``variant``, ``addon``,
    ``optional``, and ``debug``. By default, the kickstart will include all repos
    of the given type. Repos are also created in yum.repos.d/ and enabled.
    Set this variable if you want to omit ``repo`` command in kickstart and
    disable them in yum.repos.d/. You can find repo id for a particular distro
    tree under the :guilabel:`Repos` tab on the distro tree page.
    For example disable_debug_repos.

``disable_onerror``
    Don't add the ``%onerror`` section to the kickstart. By default the section
    is added for RHEL 7 and newer. It handles the installation failure reporting
    it to Beaker and aborting the recipe. This option disables this functionality.

``ethdevices=<module>[,<module>...]``
    Comma-separated list of network modules to be loaded during installation.

``firewall=<port>:<protocol>[,<port>:<protocol>...]``
    Firewall ports to allow, for example ``firewall=imap:tcp,1234:ucp,47``. If 
    this variable is not set, the firewall is disabled.

``firstboot=<option>``
    Option to be passed directly to the ``firstboot`` kickstart command.
    The complete option string must be given, including ``--`` and ``=``.

``fstype``
    Filesystem type for all filesystems. Default is to allow the installer to 
    choose.

``grubport=<hexaddr>``
    Hex address of the I/O port which GRUB should use for serial output. If 
    this variable is set, the value will be passed to the ``--port`` option of 
    the ``serial`` command in the GRUB configuration. Refer to `serial in the 
    GRUB manual <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#serial>`__.

``harness=<alternative harness>``
    Specify the test harness to use instead of the default test
    harness, "beah". With the ``contained_harness`` variable
    specified, this defaults to "restraint".

    To learn more, see the :ref:`alternative-harnesses`.

``harness_docker_base_image=<image>``
    If specified, uses this docker image to build the Docker container
    that the test runs in. The <image> is expected to be in a form usable in a Dockerfile's
    `FROM <http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#from>`__
    instruction. If ``contained_harness_entrypoint`` is not specified,
    the distro should use "systemd" as the process manager.

    If not specified, Beaker will attempt to build the container by
    fetching the same image as that of the host distro from the Docker
    public registry. Thus, if Fedora 20 is used on the host machine,
    the image used will be: "registry.hub.docker.com/fedora:20".

``hwclock_is_utc``
    If defined, the hardware clock is assumed to be set in UTC rather than
    local time. It's defined by default for guest recipes and dynamic VMs.

``ignoredisk=<options>``
    Options to be passed directly to the ``ignoredisk`` kickstart command. The 
    complete option string must be given, including ``--`` and ``=``.
    
    Use this to skip certain disks during the installation, for example 
    ``ignoredisk=--drives=sdb,sdc``, or to use only certain disks for the 
    installation, for example ``ignoredisk=--only-use=sda,sdb``.

``install_task_requires``
    If defined, Beaker will include the packages required by every task in the
    recipe. The packages will be populated in the kickstart ``%packages`` section,
    causing Anaconda to install them.

    For Fedora 29 and RHEL8 and later versions, this variable is *not* defined
    by default. The default harness, Restraint, will install task requirements
    before executing each task.

    This variable *is* defined by default for older distros, where the default harness is Beah.
    Beah does not install task requirements, instead it relies on the requirements being
    populated in %packages and installed by Anaconda.

``keyboard=<layout>``
    Keyboard layout to use. Default is ``us``.

``ks_keyword``
    Change the normal kickstart kernel command line keyword from 'ks' to user
    specified value. This can be useful for instance if wanting to install an
    operating system like Debian. Could do ``ks_keyword=preseed`` and then the
    kickstart file will be generated but on kernel command it would be present
    as ``preseed=http://example.com/kickstart/18`` as an example. A custom
    preseed template will need to be created and put in
    ``/etc/beaker/kickstarts/``.  For example if doing a Debian install the
    file ``/etc/beaker/kickstarts/Debian`` should be created.

``lang=<localeid>``
    Locale to use. Default is ``en_US.UTF-8``.

``manual``
    Omits most kickstart commands, causing Anaconda to prompt for details. The 
    effect is similar to booting from install media with no kickstart. 
    Typically it is also necessary to set ``mode=vnc``. For systems with
    console log monitoring enabled, it will also be necessary to switch off
    :ref:`installation failure monitoring
    <disable-install-failure-detection>`.

``method=<method>``
   Installation method to use. Default is ``nfs``, supported alternatives
   include ``http`` and ``nfs+iso``. The specific installation methods
   supported for a particular distro tree in a particular lab will depend on
   how the distro was imported into Beaker. The available methods can be
   determined through the web UI by looking at the URL schemes listed for
   the distro tree.

``mode=<mode>``
    Installation mode to use. Valid values are ``text`` (curses-like 
    interface), ``cmdline`` (plain text with no interaction), ``graphical`` 
    (local X server), and ``vnc`` (graphical interface over VNC). The default 
    mode is either ``text`` or ``cmdline``, depending on arch and distro.

``no_autopart``
    Omits the ``autopart`` command. By default when no specific partitions are
    requested for a recipe, the kickstart will include ``autopart`` which causes
    the installer to automatically select a suitable partition layout. Set this
    variable if you want to supply explicit partitioning commands in some other
    way, for example in a ``<ks_append/>`` section.

``no_networks``
    Omits the ``network`` command. By default when no specific network is
    requested for a recipe, the kickstart will include
    ``network --bootproto=dhcp`` which causes the installer to obtain it's
    networking configuration from DHCP server. Set this variable if you want
    to supply explicit network setting in kernel options.

``no_repo_<id>``
    Omits repo of the given id. You can find repo id for a particular distro
    tree under the :guilabel:`Repos` tab on the distro tree page.
    For example no_repo_CRB-debuginfo.

``no_<type>_repos``
    Omits repos of the given type. Valid types include ``variant``, ``addon``, 
    ``optional``, and ``debug``. You can find which repo types are available 
    for a particular distro tree under the :guilabel:`Repos` tab on the distro 
    tree page.

``no_clock_sync``
    Omits additional packages and scripts which ensure the system clock is 
    synchronized after installation.

``no_default_harness_repo``
    If you have your own repository providing a test harness, this
    variable can be used to prevent Beaker from configuring the default Beaker
    harness repository in the kickstart.

``no_disable_readahead``
    By default Beaker disables readahead collection, because it is not 
    generally useful in Beaker recipes and the harness interferes with normal 
    data collection. If this variable is set, Beaker omits the snippet which 
    disables readahead collection.

``no_updates_repos``
    Omits the fedora-updates repo for Fedora.

``liveimg``
    Specify a relative path to an image file or rpm that contains a squashfs 
    image.  For more details, see the `kickstart documentation <http://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html#liveimg>`

``ostree_repo_url``
    Specify the repo location for rpm-ostree. See ``has_rpmostree`` below.

``ostree_ref``
    Specify the remote ref for rpm-ostree. See ``has_rpmostree`` below.

``packages=<package>:<package>``
    Colon-separated list of package names to be installed during provisioning. 
    If this variable is set, it replaces any packages defined by default in the 
    kickstart templates. It also replaces any packages requested by the recipe, 
    including task requirements.

    In a recipe, considering using the ``<package/>`` element instead. This 
    augments the package list instead of replacing it completely.

``password=<encrypted>``
    Root password to use. Must be encrypted in the conventional 
    :manpage:`crypt(3)` format.

``pkgoptions=<options>``
    Options to pass to the ``%packages`` section in the kickstart file.  If
    this variable is set, it overrides the default option ``--ignoremissing``.
    See the `kickstart documentation <http://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html#chapter-7-package-selection>`
    for the available options to ``%packages``.

``remote_post=<url>``
    Specify a URL to a script to be executed post-install. The script must specify a
    interpreter using the ``#!`` line if not a bash script. This is especially useful
    for systems set to Manual mode. If you are scheduling a job, a
    simpler alternative is to embed a ``%post`` scriptlet directly in your
    job XML using the ``<ks_append/>`` element.

``rootfstype``
    Filesystem type for the root filesystem. Default is to allow the installer 
    to choose.

``scsidevices=<module>[,<module>...]``
    Comma-separated list of SCSI modules to be loaded during installation.

``selinux=<state>``
    SELinux state to set. Valid values are ``--disabled``, ``--permissive``, 
    and ``--enforcing``. Default is ``--enforcing``.

``skipx``
    Do not configure X on the installed system. This is needed for headless 
    systems which lack graphics support.

``static_networks=<device>,<ipv4_address>[;...]``
    Configure one or more network devices to start on boot with static IPv4 
    addresses. The device should be given as a kernel device name (for example, 
    ``em1``) or MAC address. The IPv4 address should be given with its netmask 
    in CIDR notation (for example, ``192.168.99.1/24``).

    Note that the network device used for installation is always set to start 
    on boot with DHCP activation.

``swapsize``
    Size of the swap partition in MB.

``timezone=<tzname>``
    Time zone to use. Default is ``America/New_York`` unless overridden by the 
    administrator.

``yum_install_extra_opts``
    Extra command-line options which will be passed to all invocations of ``yum 
    install`` which Beaker produces in the generated kickstart.
    
    On RHEL3 and RHEL4 this variable defaults to "-d 1" which inhibits Yum's 
    progress bar made up of hashes which can take a long time to print. On 
    newer releases, where Yum's progress bar produces less output, this 
    variable is undefined.

.. _kickstart-metadata-distro-features:

Distro features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following kickstart metadata variables are used to test for
installer or distro features. Beaker populates these variables
automatically by inspecting the distro name and version. They can be
overridden if necessary for custom distros.

``boot_partition_size``
    Recommended size of the ``/boot`` partition according to the product 
    documentation. This is only populated for RHEL 6 and older releases, where 
    the installer does not support the ``--recommended`` option for the 
    ``part`` command. In newer releases the installer correctly determines the 
    recommended size.

``docker_package``
    The package name for Docker container engine is ``docker-io`` on
    Fedora 20/21 and ``docker`` starting with Fedora rawhide (`bugzilla report
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1043676>`__),
    CentOS 7 and RHEL 7.

``end``
    Set to ``%end`` on distros which support it, or to the empty string on 
    older distros.

``has_autopart_type``
    Indicates that the ``autopart`` kickstart command accepts a ``--type`` 
    option.

``has_chrony``
    Indicates that chrony is available in the distro.

``has_dhcp_mtu_support``
    Indicates that the DHCP client obeys option 26 for controlling the network 
    interface MTU. Support for this DHCP option is required for a recipe to run 
    successfully in OpenStack. All modern distributions from RHEL 5 onwards 
    support this.

``has_gpt_bios_support``
    Indicates that the installer is capable of formatting disks using GPT on 
    x86 systems with BIOS firmware.

    This support is needed for disks larger than 2TB and it requires an extra 
    "BIOS boot" partition to be defined.

``has_key``
    Indicates that the distro requires the ``key`` command. This command
    exists only on RHEL 5 and CentOS 5.

``has_leavebootorder``
    Indicates that the ``bootloader`` command accepts a ``--leavebootorder`` 
    option.

``has_repo_cost``
    Indicates that the ``repo`` command accepts a ``--cost`` option.

``has_reqpart``
    Indicates that the installer supports the ``reqpart`` command for adding 
    platform-specific partition requirements.

``has_rpmostree``
    If specified, Beaker assumes that the specified distribution is 
    `rpm-ostree <http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/os-updates/>`__
    based (an `Atomic host <http://www.projectatomic.io/>`__, for
    example). The test harness is run inside a Docker container and
    the tests are run inside it instead of the host system. The OSTree
    location and ref must be specified using ``ostree_repo_url`` and
    ``ostree_ref`` respectively.

    Also, see ``harness_docker_base_image`` and
    ``contained_harness_entrypoint`` above.

``has_systemd``
    Indicates that the distro uses systemd rather than SysV init.

``has_unsupported_hardware``
    Indicates that the ``unsupported_hardware`` kickstart command is accepted.

``yum``
    Unset, except on older distros which require the yum package to be fetched 
    and installed.

.. _ksappend:

Appended kickstart content
--------------------------

In your job XML you can specify extra content to be appended to the generated 
kickstart, using the ``<ks_appends/>`` element. For example::

    <recipe>
        ...
        <ks_appends>
            <ks_append><![CDATA[
    %post
    echo "This is my extra %post script"
    %end
            ]]></ks_append>
        </ks_appends>
    </recipe>

.. _custom-kickstarts:

Custom kickstart templates
--------------------------

You can also specify a complete kickstart template in your job XML, using the 
``<kickstart/>`` element. Note that if a custom template is supplied, the other 
customization mechanisms described above (``ksmeta=`` and ``<ks_appends/>``) 
will have no effect, unless the custom template also obeys those 
customizations.

Beakerâs kickstart templates are written in the Jinja2 templating language. 
Refer to the `Jinja2 documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ for details 
of the template syntax and built-in constructs which are available to all 
templates.

All kickstart metadata variables are available to the kickstart template. That 
includes variables set on the recipe, the system, the distro, the OS major, and 
system-wide in the Beaker configuration. It also includes distro feature 
variables (see :ref:`kickstart-metadata-distro-features` above) which are 
particularly useful in kickstart templates for handling differences between 
distros and versions.

A number of additional Beaker-specific Jinja filters, tests, and variables are 
defined in the template environment. They are described below.

Jinja filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:function:: dictsplit(delim=',', pairsep=':')

   Returns a dict based on a sequence of key-value pairs encoded in a string,
   like this::

        type:mdraid,part:swap,size:256

.. py:function:: parsed_url

   Parses a URL using :py:func:`urlparse.urlparse`.

.. py:function:: shell_quoted

   Quotes a string using :py:func:`pipes.quote`, suitable for interpolation as 
   an argument into a shell command.

.. py:function:: split(delim=None)

   Splits on whitespace, or the given delimiter. See :py:func:`string.split`.

.. py:function:: urljoin(relativeurl)

   Resolves a relative URL against a base URL. For example::

        {{ 'http://example.com/distros/'|urljoin('RHEL-6.2/') }}

   will evaluate to ``http://example.com/distros/RHEL-6.2/`` in the kickstart.

Jinja tests
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:function:: arch(arch, ...)

   Tests whether a distro tree's arch matches any of the given arches. For 
   example::

        {% if distro_tree is arch('i386', 'x86_64') %}

.. py:function:: osmajor(osmajor, ...)

   Tests whether a distro matches any of the given OS major names. For 
   example::

        {% if distro is osmajor('CentOS6', 'RedHatEnterpriseLinux6') %}

   In most cases it is preferable to use a distro feature variable rather than 
   hard-coding all possible OS major names.

.. py:function:: osversion(osversion, ...)

   Tests whether a distro matches any of the given OS versions. For example::

        {% if distro is osversion('CentOS6.0', 'RedHatEnterpriseLinux6.0') %}

Template variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:function:: absolute_url(path, **kwargs)

   A function which returns the absolute URL to the given path within the 
   Beaker application. *kwargs* are converted to query parameters.

.. py:function:: chr(i)

   The built-in :py:mod:`chr` function, which returns a byte with the given 
   integer value.

.. py:data:: distro

   The distro which is being provisioned. This object has the following 
   attributes:

   ``name``
        Name of the distro, for example "Fedora-Server-21_Alpha".

   ``osversion``
        Object representing the distro's version.

   ``osversion.osminor``
        OS minor version (the portion after the first period).

   ``osversion.osmajor``
        Object representing the OS major version.

   ``osversion.osmajor.name``
        Name portion of the OS major version, for example "Fedora".
    
   ``osversion.osmajor.number``
        Numerical portion of the OS major version, for example "21". Note that 
        this is a string, not an integer, because it might be "rawhide".
