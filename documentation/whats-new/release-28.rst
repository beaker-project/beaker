What's New in Beaker 28?
========================

Beaker 28 uses Restraint as the default test harness for all OS releases,
iPXE support, enhanced installation failure detection and some other
features.

Restraint as the default harness for all distributions
------------------------------------------------------

`Restraint <https://restraint.readthedocs.io/>`_ is now the default test
harness, for all recipes. This means RHEL 5+, all currently supported
Fedora releases and Fedora Rawhide.

Support for Beah remains. You can select it by using
``harness=beah`` in the kickstart metadata of your recipes. However,
now it is necessary to add ``install_task_requires`` to kickstart
metadata if you would like to populate the ``packages`` section.

Support <kickstart/> without a template
---------------------------------------

By default ``<kickstart />`` XML tag is used to add extra kickstart
command to predefined template. We noticed that it may not suit
all users; therefore, we added a support to define your own kickstart
under ``<kickstart>``. You can enable this feature with ``no_ks_template``
in your metadata.

Kickstart defined by ``<kickstart>`` will use our Jinja2 template
mechanism, therefore it is highly recommended to combine it with our
snippets. Especially with ``clear_netboot`` (Removes PXE files).

Warning: This feature bypasses common safeguards that might have been
put in place by Beaker instance administrators and might render some
systems unbootable if used incorrectly. Use with care.

For example
.. code-block:: XML

    <job retention_tag="scratch">
        <recipe whiteboard="" role="None" ks_meta="no_ks_template" kernel_options="" kernel_options_post="">
            <kickstart>
                {% snippet 'clear_netboot' %}

            </kickstart>

    </job>

iPXE support
------------

iPXE is a NIC boot ROM that can be flashed into devices, chain loaded
from other boot agents, run as a UEFI executable, booted from physical
media, etc.

In addition to extending boot support to protocols beyond
TFTP, iPXE also includes powerful scripting support. This adds support
for devices booting into the Beaker environment using that scripting
support.

The behavior here is largely modeled after PXELINUX, however
note that iPXE does not start fetching files with patterns based on
device MAC address, IP address, or any of that when it loads, nor does
it fetch a `default` file.

For more details please refer to :ref:`boot-loader-images`.

Enhanced installation failure detection
---------------------------------------

Previously, we relied on output from ``console`` to detect installation
failures. This may not work for several reasons.

* Machine is not attached to console server.
* Error strings are always changing and Beaker is unaware of new error.
* Reservesys Workflow completely ignores installation failures.

Now, we use combination of approach mentioned above and ``%onerror``
section. If installer hits a fatal error and ``%onerror`` section
is executed we abort installation automatically.

This is supported on RHEL7+ and all Fedora. However, it can be disabled
by ``disable_onerror`` defined in kickstart metadata.

Multi-console log support
-------------------------

In conjunction with an external console logging system (such as
`conserver <http://www.conserver.com/>`__), Beaker also supports the
automatic capture of the console logs for the duration of provisioning
and execution of a recipe.

We decided to extend this support. Previously, Beaker was reading the
only output of file defined by ``FQDN`` for a given system.

With multi-console support, you can get output from multiple consoles.
The only requirement is that name of the file has to start with
``FQDN-``.

For example following files will be logged as console files:

* ``CONSOLE_LOGS``/test.example.com -> console.log
* ``CONSOLE_LOGS``/test.example.com-bmc -> console-bmc.log
* ``CONSOLE_LOGS``/test.example.com-serial2 -> console-serial2.log
