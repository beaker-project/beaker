# We don't declare bkr as a namespace package, because we want to actually
# install our bkr/__init__.py file. However, if we don't put the right
# metadata in place during installation, then pkg_resources gets confused and
# prints out an incredibly cryptic warning message if you're developing on
# a system that also has the beaker system package installed.
# (see https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/2/ for details)
#
# Thus, there is a post-adjustment in "make install" which adds the relevant
# metadata to the installed .egg-info directory for the main beaker package.
