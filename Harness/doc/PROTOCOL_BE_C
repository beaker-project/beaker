== Backend(BE)-Controller(C) ==

Using following notation in this document:
-> cmd          # BE->C
<- evt          # BE<-C

=== Echo ===
Any command will result in echo event.

-> cmd
<- echo(rc, cmd)

=== New BE ===

==== Introduce ====
Set BE's name. OPTIONAL

-> name(name)
(
    <- echo(OK)     # if OK
OR
    <- echo(*)      # name is already active
)

==== No output ====
This BE does not process events. OPTIONAL

-> no_output()
<- echo(*)      # BE has to process events anyway - there are some events sent
anyway

==== Always on ====
pause if this BE fails. OPTIONAL
Requires name to be set.

-> always_on(True)
(
    <- echo(OK)     # alway on set
OR
    <- echo(*)      # could not set - likely problem with name?
)

==== Restart ====
In case of C's failure, C can send a restart executable pathname.
This has to be standalone - e.g. it has to set up environment and run C.

<- launcher(pathname)

=== BE is quitting ===

-> bye()
set timeout
(
    <- echo(OK)
    ...
    <- bye_bye()
    close()
OR
    <- echo(*)      # this should not happen!
    if always_on:
        -> always_on(False)
        <- echo(*)
    close()     - close anyway.
OR
    timeout expired
    close()
)

=== C is quitting (in a clean way) ===

<- bye()
close()

=== C was interrupted ===

on_closed:
set timeout
- try to reconnect
if timeout expired:
- try to restart C [ problem: what configuration to use? ]

=== C is idle ===
Send when there is no running task.

<- idle()

=== Start a task ===

-> run(task_info)       # task_info is used to identify task within BE/C.
(
    <- echo(OK)
    ...
    <- start(task_info)     # task_info can contain C specific information.
                            # Save it and use for sending commands to C
OR
    <- echo (*)
)

=== Task finished ===
Each task has to send a finish message to C, which will forward it to BE

<- end(task_info, rc)   # rc is either OK, or failure 

# vim:et:sw=4:ts=4
